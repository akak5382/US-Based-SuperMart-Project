# US-Based-SuperMart-Project
The goal of this project is to generate dynamic reports for category, brand, product, and store-level insights using the order_details_v1, product_hierarchy_v1, and store_cities_v1 datasets. These reports will help analyze trends, performance, and growth metrics to support data-driven business decision-making.
